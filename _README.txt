To create the redirection file for the first time:
-	Change your community to CancerGov_Community
-	Create a new File content type
-	Title: RedirectionList.txt
-	Short Title: RedirectionList.txt
-	Upload the RedirectionList.txt file
-	Save it and push it  live


The URL should NOT include www.cancer.gov, it should start with a "/"
For example:

Move www.cancer.gov/researchandfunding/MERIT/2012/kinzler
to www.cancer.gov/researchandfunding/nci-role/spotlight/merit/kinzler
in the RedirectionList.txt it will look like this:
/researchandfunding/MERIT/2012/kinzler, /researchandfunding/nci-role/spotlight/merit/kinzler

The excel sheet RedirectionList.txt should be converted to a csv file and renamed to "RedirectionList.txt"
